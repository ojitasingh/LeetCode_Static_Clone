Problem Solving Stats: Shows categorized problem counts (Easy, Medium, Hard) with progress bars.

Streak Activity: Visual calendar showing a 21-day activity streak.

Recent Submissions: Table listing recent problem submissions with difficulty, status, and timestamps.

Responsive Design: Optimized for desktop and mobile screens.

File Structure
Leetcode_Static_Clone.html: Main HTML file with embedded styles and scripts.

No external assets or frameworks are required.

Usage
